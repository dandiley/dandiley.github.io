					<h4>Why share support?</h4><br>
					<p>More than 33% of Filipino youngsters are malnourished as a result of the country's hunger issues. Malnutrition brought on by hunger issues has a long-term detrimental impact on children's health.
					<br><br>
					The Philippines has one of the highest levels of hunger among the nations that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
					<br><br>
					In the world, there are approximately 520 million malnourished people. The number of malnourished people in the Philippines is among the greatest. The Philippines' islands were part of the Asia area, which generally has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world.</p>

						<p>This price is right for fantasy display only, you can send any amount that was came from your heart and the coins were already enough for someone with an empty stomach.
						People out there will certainly value what you can share :)</p> <br>

						<p>However, if you do not have an extra penny, you can still send your support by praying for them, this way is far more powerful than anything.
						You can also subscribe to my YouTube channel, it might be helpful in the future to help more people who are hungry and can't afford to eat every day.
