					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<br>

					<p>Ahoy, mate! I'm Leydan, but you can call me Dan. <br>I love playing adventure games and I can say that most of the time I'm in front of my laptop playing games and hanging out with my friends in different countries.<br>I started my own team in 2018 and managed to get better at leading and communicating, which means I applied it in real life. For me, a game is not just a game, it's the way we interact and resolve things together to strive for success. However, I have already quit playing after getting into my first developer job.<br><br>When it comes to work, just like the game I've treated my work as a game where every bug is a quest that I need to fix and then when I fulfilled it, I will have a reward in the game that is in fact you will gain knowledge. That's why I'm always passionate about work and daily learning to uncover my own treasure in life.

					<p>I'm a pluviophile <i>"someone who loves rain",</i> I find peace hearing the raindrop on the ground and having the satisfaction of breathing in the smell of the earth after the rain. I enjoy spending time alone. Being by myself with no distractions gives me the chance to clear my mind, focus, and think more clearly. It's an opportunity to revitalize my mind and body at the same time. <br> In addition, I want to travel to different museums while listening to an old music that reminds me of something that I can't express.

				<p>I work as an EDI software Engineer and somehow
				I'm a Front End Developer during my free time and quite interested entering the Backend too. I graduated college earning a Bachelor degree in
				Electronics Communication Engineer. I'm into developing creative stuff and presenting unique ideas, although I need to know more about Graphics to be able to produce my own images.</p> 

				<br><br><p> If I can turn my career around in the blink of an eye, I probably want to become an astronaut and work for NASA. Space exploration is one of my biggest fantasies.</p>
